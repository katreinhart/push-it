# PUSH_IT 
#### (picking up stuff that's heavy and putting it back down)
by Kat Reinhart  

## Motivation
As a busy Web Development Immersive student, I don't have as much time for working out as I once did, so I focus on "bang for your buck" workouts like running and weightlifting. As a huge nerd and endurance athlete, I enjoy tracking my workouts with metrics so that I can see progress over time.    

Many apps exist on the market for tracking running and cycling workouts, but I have not found one that I like for tracking weightlifting progress. 

Issues that I have found with existing apps:
1. Too "bro-y"
1. Too focused on beginners
1. Lock you in to a specific program
1. Are not free

Therefore, I decided to build my own app to track my weightlifting workouts. 

## User Stories
- I want to track my strength training sessions on my phone at the gym.  
- I want to create a new workout.  
- I want to add exercises to a workout.  
- I want to save my workout after I have finished it.  
- I want to keep track of reps, sets, and weight for my lifts.  
- I want to see charts of my progress as well as lifetime and recent PRs for all lifts.  
- I want to be able to set a goal and see it every time I log into the app.

## Installation
If you want to run this app locally, you will need Xcode 9 running on a Mac (OS 10.12 or later).
- Fork and clone this repository to your local Xcode projects directory. 
- Open the PUSH_IT.xcworkspace file 
- Select an iPhone from the emulator list (designed with 6/7/8 screen sizes in mind)
- Build and run the project. 
- Create a login at the prompt or use test user login credentials: ```test@example.com password```

If you want to run it on your own hardware, you will need an iPhone running iOS 11. You will also need to allow apps from my developer certificate in your device's Settings -> General -> Profiles & Device Management. 

If you would like to be placed on the list to beta test the app when I release it in Test Flight, please contact me at kat.reinhart@gmail.com or via Twitter @katreinhart.
